# Introduction
This is a personal project of mine to practise the full process from data collection to data analysis. 
In this project, I use Riot Games' API to fetch my personal match history data, process & query it, produce dashboards and perform analysis on it.

## Data Collection
Here is the .ipynb file where i fetch my match history data using Riot's api. Take note that it is rather outdated, as servers & server names have changed.
