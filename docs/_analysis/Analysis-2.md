This project is part of my presentation for the capstone project of a course on Coursera: Increasing Real Estate Management Profits: Harnessing Data Analysis. The goal of the project is to investigate whether it would be financially viable for Watershed to convert their long-term rental properties into short-term rental properties.

The relevant dashboard for the project can be found [here.](https://meng-kiat.github.io/dashboards/Watershed Dashboard/)
